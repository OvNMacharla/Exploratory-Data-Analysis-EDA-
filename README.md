#Project Summary

A complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to explore survival patterns among passengers using data cleaning, statistical summaries, and visualizations.

#Data Story

The Titanic dataset reveals clear survival patterns among passengers:

Women and children had much higher survival rates compared to men.

First-class passengers were more likely to survive, highlighting a strong link between social class and survival chances.

The age distribution showed that most passengers were between 20–40 years old, and survival was highest among younger passengers.

The correlation heatmap indicated that Fare and Pclass (ticket class) had a noticeable relationship with Survived, suggesting that wealth played a major role.

#✅ Conclusion:
The tragedy of the Titanic highlights the inequalities of the time — gender and class significantly influenced survival. Passengers with higher social standing and access to lifeboats had much greater chances of surviving.
